## Microsoft_Malware_detection: a Project for Security Class

### * This link below is for the project Write-up (sorry! github cannot open a file this big, it has to be downloaded)
[The Report](https://github.com/SamAlqarzi/Microsoft_Malware_detection/blob/main/Project%20Report_%20Microsoft%20Kaggle.docx)

### * This link will open the juypter notebook that has all the complied python code as well as the link to kaggle dataset:
[The code](https://github.com/SamAlqarzi/Microsoft_Malware_detection/blob/main/Microsoft_malware_project.ipynb)

### * Instructions on Running the Code:
##### * The commented code in the first four cells is for downloading the data from kaggle using google colab
##### * Unless you're using the google drive as 'the path' to load the datasets, (the code in the cells 6-9 is NOT for you)
##### * After being able to load the data into the notebook, the code should run smoothly
